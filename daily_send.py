"""
This script sends out the daily messages for DadJokeJunkie.com

Will be kicked off by cron job, so all code in script will execute.

Steps:
1) Load all libraries and initialize everything
2) Select phone numbers from DB of people who are eligible (where Stop=0)
3) Randomly load joke of the day (from Jokes)
4) Write back to Jokes, incrementing the joke count
5) Update the DailyJokes (history table) with the joke of the day
6) Loop through user list, sending the joke to each user
7) If code returns "STOP" (or whatever it is), update Users table with Stop=1
8) Done
